TODO/To consider: 

In theory, we can quite easily implement a 'wallet' via OOP approach and define
standard functions (generate_key(), add_key(), retrieve_key(), shard_key() etc) and 
associate each actor (alice, carol, bob etc) with a unique wallet to interact with. 
However, this is outside the scope of the current demo so consider it future work for now.
